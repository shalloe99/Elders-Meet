# Elders-Meet

Our presentation is posted on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l41ytjeqN5E

## Inspiration
In difficult times facing the world, it has made us more aware about the people we care most. The group facing the harshest restriction are the elderly member of our families. We wanted them to be able to connect with one another and ourselves in an easy and efficient way.

## What it does
With Elders Meet, it will allow those isolated to connect easily with others in isolation by finding matching interests that will give them an initial conversational topic.

## How we built it
We used React Native to build it.

## Challenges we ran into
We had problems running React Native on Windows. After many trials and errors, we decided to concentrate on members with Macbooks.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud that we created a project that will benefit elderly individuals. During times of crisis, elders are impacted the most, and we want to show that we care about them.

## What we learned
We learned that making beautiful apps took longer than expected. Making UI that was suitable for elders was even harder for us, as we had to put ourselves in their shoes.

## What's next for Elders Meet
With Elders Meet, we hope to encourage and facilitate the communication of those who lack the ability for face to face contact. With senior population in mind, we hope to create a platform that is easy to use and efficient to provide the best possible experience for the user.
